# Moody

Moody is an AI agent. Its goal is to help users find music based on a prompt. We see it as a step toward what I believe will be the future of human-computer interaction: we will be able to write or speak (and perhaps even think) a command, and the computer will be able to execute the necessary actions to fulfill it.

To run locally: 
- clone repository
- run `npm i`
- create .env file and replace the following with your tokens:
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=ae...71`
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=6b...6b`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=3H...M=`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk...vS`
- run `npm run dev`
